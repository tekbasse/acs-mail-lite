Development notes and change log


Documentation changes are too numerous to deliniate.
General strategy is to separate into topics of:
setup, inbound email configuration, outbound email configuration,
and inbound email for package developers

Portions of the following sources have been added to ACS Mail Lite docs:

http://openacs.org/xowiki/incoming_email
http://openacs.org/forums/message-view?message_id=543694

Some suggestions have been incorporated into new code.

A collection of example email headers are included.
Unit tests in acs-mail-lite/tcl/test/email-inbound-procs.tcl use these.
Ones from other sources on web are compatible
with OpenACS' distribution license and include attribution.
Each set of example email headers is in a separate file in this package:
 acs-mail-lite/www/doc/headers-example-N.txt
where N is a natural number.


API changes

If row listed in 'From' column is blank, the item in 'To' column same row is new.

                                 ns_imap header #s msgno
                                 ns_imap header #s msgno hdrname
                                 ns_imap headers #s msgno ?-array name?
                                 ns_imap text #s msgno ?-flags flags?
                                 ns_imap body #s msgno part ?-flags flags? ?-decode? ?-file name?
acs_mail_lite::load_mails        acs_mail_lite::load_via_imap

                                 ns_imap struct #s msgno ?-flags flags? ?-array name?
                                 ns_imap bodystruct #s msgno part ?-flags flags? ?-array name?
                                 fetches all the structured information
                                 (envelope, internal date, RFC 822 size, flags, and body structure) for
                                 the given msgno and returns it as a Tcl name value list
                                 ns_imap bodystruct fetches just one particular message body part.
                                 if array name is specified result will be placed into array variable

                                 acs_mail_lite::parameters
                                  returns parameter names and values as a name value list 
                                 acs_mail_lite::parameters -name value 
                                  sets value to parameter 'name'
                                  This api bypasses issues of value updates not detected
                                  by scheduled procs by using existing OpenACS parameter api


New parameters added to new section: inbound_email

Parameters
 BounceScanQueue (not in use)    IncomingScanRate
 send_immediately                SendImmediatelyP
                                 IMAPHost
                                 IMAPPassword
                                 IMAPPort
                                 IMAPTimeout
                                 IMAPUser
                                 IncomingFilterProcName
                                 ExternalSource default is blank. Value is prefixed to value of table.name: default acs_mail_lite_email_uid_map.src_ext value. Suggest setting to mailbox.host before use, or leave blank. Changing value resets memory of prior processed emails. To avoid re-processing prior email, do not change once a service is in use. Restart server after changing value for it to take effect.
