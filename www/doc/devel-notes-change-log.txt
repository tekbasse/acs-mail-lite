Development notes and change log



Documentation changes are too numerous to deliniate.
General strategy is to separate into topics of:
setup, inbound email configuration, outbound email configuration,
and inbound email for package developers

Portions of these sources have been added to new docs:

http://openacs.org/xowiki/incoming_email
http://openacs.org/forums/message-view?message_id=543694

Some suggestions have been incorporated into new code.
