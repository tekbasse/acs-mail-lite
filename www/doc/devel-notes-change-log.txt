Development notes and change log


Documentation changes are too numerous to deliniate.
General strategy is to separate into topics of:
setup, inbound email configuration, outbound email configuration,
and inbound email for package developers

Portions of the following sources have been added to ACS Mail Lite docs:

http://openacs.org/xowiki/incoming_email
http://openacs.org/forums/message-view?message_id=543694

Some suggestions have been incorporated into new code.

A collection of example email headers are included.
Unit tests in acs-mail-lite/tcl/test/email-inbound-procs.tcl use these.
Ones from other sources on web are compatible
with OpenACS' distribution license and include attribution.
Each set of example email headers is in a separate file in this package:
 acs-mail-lite/www/doc/headers-example-N.txt
where N is a natural number.


New parameters added to new section: IMAP

Parameters
                                 IMAPHost
                                 IMAPPassword
                                 IMAPPort
                                 IMAPTimeout
                                 IMAPUser
                                 IncomingFilterProcName
                                 ExternalSource default is blank. Value is prefixed to value of table.name: default acs_mail_lite_email_uid_map.src_ext value. Suggest setting to mailbox.host before use, or leave blank. Changing value resets memory of prior processed emails. To avoid re-processing prior email, do not change once a service is in use. Restart server after changing value for it to take effect.
